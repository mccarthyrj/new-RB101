one:
given two integers 
Add first integer to the second
return the sum

two:
given an array of strings
iterate over that array
concatenate each index to the next
return the result of the concatenated strings

three:
given an array of integers

store every other integer starting at the first index into a new array
return the new array

four:
given a string
iterate over the string
identify matching characters
count occurrence of a specific character
return index number of the third occurrence of a character
return nil if character occurs less than 3 times

five:
given two arrays
create new empty array
initialize an iterator
push first array at index equal to iterator into new array
push second array at index equal to iterator into new array
reassign iterator to iterator + 1
return new array
